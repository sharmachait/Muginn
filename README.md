In Norse mythology, Huginn and Muninn are a pair of ravens that fly all over the world and bring information to the god Odin.

Muginn from *One Piece* is also a raven inspired by the aforementioned duo that lives in the Land of Gods, Elbaf.

This project is my hand at the Build Your Own Kafka challenge, a software that is essentially a message broker system, befitting the name Muginn.

In this project, we will tackle features like:

1. Handling Concurrent clients
2. Listing Partitions and Topics
3. Consuming messages from Topics and Disks
